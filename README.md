A number of tools are included. Ideally they'll provide a launch pad for others to create their own.

Note that BlinkScript was made available to Nuke Non-commercial users in version 14.0v3, so the BlinkScripts will work there. Regardless, prefer the `.nk` version of the model itself.

Massive thanks to project co-author [calvinsilly](https://github.com/calvinsilly), whose efforts this model would not exist without.

Check out a [similar model by Juan Pablo Zambrano](https://github.com/JuanPabloZambrano/DCTL/tree/main/NormSphericalCoords), which has two chroma normalization modes.
